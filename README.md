# ChaosGameRepresentationSequence
Chaos Game Representation of sequences -> similarity metric -> MDS

## Notes
Clustering based on visualization of hierarchy in sequence using Chaos Game Representation. Then compute a dissimilarity metric and reduce dimensionality and visualize clusterings of sequences using multidimensional scaling.
